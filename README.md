# Parkinson's-Disease-Detection
The main focus of this study is to classify the speech measurements present in the Voice dataset for Parkinson Disease that contains features such as jitter and shimmer in the speech of the person. Supervised ML algorithms are used to classify a person as positive or negative for Parkinsonâ€™s disease based on the labelled features. Finally unsupervised ML algorithms will be also used to make sense of the information by clustering when labelled data is not present. This can help in the early diagnosis of the disease and help the doctors suggest necessary precautions and methods in reducing the effects of this disease.
